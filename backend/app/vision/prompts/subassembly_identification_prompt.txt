Analyze this LEGO instruction manual step and determine if it creates a SUBASSEMBLY.

STEP NUMBER: {{step_number}}

A SUBASSEMBLY is a distinct functional unit that:
- Combines multiple parts into a cohesive structure (e.g., wheel assembly, wing, base frame)
- Serves a specific purpose within the larger model
- May be attached to other parts/subassemblies in later steps

Return results as JSON:
{
  "is_subassembly": <true|false>,
  "subassembly_info": {
    "name": "descriptive name (e.g., 'Front Wheel Assembly', 'Vehicle Base')",
    "purpose": "functional description (e.g., 'Provides mobility', 'Structural foundation')",
    "component_parts": [
      "color:shape signature of each part (e.g., 'black:wheel', 'grey:axle')"
    ],
    "parent_structure": "what this subassembly attaches to (null if top-level)",
    "completeness_check": {
      "required_parts_count": <number of parts needed>,
      "required_connections": ["part_a->part_b description of key connections"],
      "spatial_signature": "overall shape/arrangement (e.g., 'circular with axle through center')"
    }
  },
  "reasoning": "explain why this is or isn't a subassembly",
  "confidence": <0.0-1.0>
}

SUBASSEMBLY DETECTION CRITERIA:
1. **Functional Grouping**: Parts that work together (wheel + axle + hub = wheel assembly)
2. **Spatial Clustering**: Parts physically connected and remain together in subsequent steps
3. **Reusable Patterns**: Symmetric structures (e.g., left/right wheels, multiple legs)
4. **Completion Keywords**: Step notes mention "complete", "assembly", "attach to"

EXAMPLES OF SUBASSEMBLIES:
- Wheel assemblies (wheel + axle + mounting bracket)
- Wings/tail sections (structural frame + decorative tiles)
- Base plates with mounted components
- Door/window frames
- Functional mechanisms (hinges, rotating parts)

NOT SUBASSEMBLIES:
- Single parts being added
- Two small pieces connecting without forming distinct unit
- Decorative elements added to existing structure

IMPORTANT:
- Focus on FUNCTIONAL groupings, not just any connected parts
- Consider if this group of parts will be referenced as a unit later
- Check if parts form a complete, recognizable structure
- Use standard LEGO terminology

EXAMPLE OUTPUT (IS SUBASSEMBLY):
{
  "is_subassembly": true,
  "subassembly_info": {
    "name": "Front Wheel Assembly",
    "purpose": "Provides mobility for front of vehicle",
    "component_parts": ["black:wheel 2x2", "grey:axle 4", "red:bracket 1x2"],
    "parent_structure": "vehicle base",
    "completeness_check": {
      "required_parts_count": 3,
      "required_connections": ["wheel->axle", "axle->bracket", "bracket->base"],
      "spatial_signature": "circular wheel with axle through center, mounted on bracket"
    }
  },
  "reasoning": "Step combines wheel, axle, and mounting bracket into functional mobility unit",
  "confidence": 0.95
}

EXAMPLE OUTPUT (NOT SUBASSEMBLY):
{
  "is_subassembly": false,
  "subassembly_info": null,
  "reasoning": "Step only adds single decorative tile to existing wall, does not form distinct functional unit",
  "confidence": 0.90
}
